## Description
Realistic deforming of rigid bodies in modern day computer games is required for immersive gameplay. This is achieved through efficient Finite Element Methods (FEM). While the game assets are usually in the form of triangular meshes, FEM operates on tetrahedral meshes. Therefore, this project aims to convert triangular mesh into tetrahedral form and visualize it.
